Diego needs to SSH into the current server, but is getting "Authentication failure" errors. Find out what is preventing him from logging in and fix it.

Diego's shell displays a quote of the day at login. Once you fix the problem, copy this quote to `/tmp/diego.flag` **as diego** to complete the task.

You can use this command to test SSH logins:
`ssh diego@localhost`
