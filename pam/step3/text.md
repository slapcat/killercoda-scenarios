User `carol` is working at home today. All employees keep their workstation at the office running and logged in 24/7 because, you know, we need to be efficient. When she attempts to login at home, she is denied.

Find and fix the issue so that Carol can login at both home and the office using the principle of least privilege. Then test a login before informing Carol and copy the `carol.flag` file to the `/tmp` directory to complete the task.

You can use this command to login:
`login carol`
